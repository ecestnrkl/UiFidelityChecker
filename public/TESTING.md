# Sample Test Images

To test the application, you can use these sample scenarios:

## Test Scenario 1: Color Difference
1. Create two similar images with different background colors
2. Upload both and compare

## Test Scenario 2: URL Capture
1. Use any public website as design mockup
2. Enter the same URL for implementation
3. Should show very high similarity (>99%)

## Test Scenario 3: Layout Differences
1. Create a mockup with specific spacing
2. Create another with slightly different margins
3. Compare to see spacing mismatches

## Live Testing
- Design: Screenshot of a design mockup from Figma/Sketch
- Implementation: Live URL of your deployed site
- Compare with Desktop (1440x900) preset

For quick testing without images, try:
- Design: Screenshot of https://example.com
- Implementation URL: https://example.com
- Should show perfect match
